###Core Motion Demo for CodeMash v2.0.1.5
This is the demo app for CodeMash v2.0.1.5 for my presentation on Core Motion. It is a tab-bar-based app with three tabs:  
	1.	Attitude: displays device's roll/pitch/yaw in degrees  
	2.	Gyroscope: displays an image that responds to gyroscopic rotation  
	3.	Pedometer: displays the day's current step count, goal, and uses [MDRadialProgress](https://github.com/mdinacci/MDRadialProgress) to show the day's progress in a nice radial menu, change to green once goal is 100%
